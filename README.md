# accident-dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard analyzing road accident data to identify patterns and suggest improvements for road safety.

## Problem Statement

**How can accident data help identify patterns and improve road safety?**  
This project aims to extract insights from accident records to support data-driven decision-making in accident prevention.

## Objectives

- Visualize accident trends based on key variables such as weather, road condition, vehicle type, and time.
- Identify high-risk factors to guide road safety initiatives.
- Support decision-makers with clear, interactive visual analytics.

## Dashboard Overview

Key insights uncovered in the dashboard:

-  **Most accidents** occurred in fine weather, though rainy conditions also contributed significantly.
-  **Dry roads** saw the highest accident counts, followed by wet roads.
-  **Single carriageways** had the most casualties.
-  **Daylight** hours saw more accidents compared to night.
-  **Cars and vans** were involved in most incidents, while **motorcycles** had a higher casualty rate.
-  **Friday** was the most accident-prone day; **Sunday** had the least.

## Data Preparation Steps

- Handled missing values and corrected erroneous entries.
- Standardized data types using Power Query Editor.
- Grouped similar categorical levels for meaningful analysis.
- Extracted date components like Year, Month, and Day for time-based patterns.
